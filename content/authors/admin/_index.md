I recently started my PhD in Computer Science with Professor Ryan Cotterell at ETH Zürich. I am passionate about the general applications of statistics and information theory to natural language processing; lately, my research has been on decoding methods for sequence models. In my free time, I like to rock climb, trail run, and search for the elusive cheap bar in Switzerland. You can check out some of my adventures on my husband's blog: http://www.timaiken.org/blog
