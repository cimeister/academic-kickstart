I'm a PhD student in Computer Science with Professor Ryan Cotterell at ETH Zürich. I am passionate about the general applications of statistics and information theory to natural language processing; lately, my research has been on decoding methods for sequence models. In my free time, I go rock climbing, trail running, and just about everything that [falls in between the two](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/254171972697256670/). You can check out some of my adventures on my husband's [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/timaiken/) and [blog](http://www.timaiken.org/blog).
