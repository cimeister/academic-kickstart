I'm a postdoc at ETH Zürich in the computer science department, working with Prof. Bernd Gärtner to design a [Masters of Advanced Studies in AI and Data Technologies](https://mas-aid.ethz.ch/).  Previously, I did my PhD at ETH supported by a Google PhD Fellowship in natural language processing. A large portion of my research in the last years has been on natural language generation---specifically, on decoding methods for probabilistic models. While my job is no longer research-related, I still occasionally work on research projects; see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=quJhNH8AAAAJ&hl=en) page for an up-to-date list of publications. Lately, I'm particularly interested in tokenization strategies for language models. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss research!

<!-- I have had the privilege of serving as the advisor for several MSc students during the writing of their theses. Some of these theses have turned into published works.
